I got a Pixel 6 and decided the new haptic feedback options were fun to play with, so I wanted an app that would just do that. I developed the ability to write Kotlin code, develop a mobile app, and grapple with an API and ecosystem as large as Android. I got some practice with my existing abilities to configure and use Gradle, design and write for compatibility and to support a variety of different devices, and apply concepts from physics.
