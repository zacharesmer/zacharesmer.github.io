This website theme grew out of my desire for a simple and extensible way to display a resume and project portfolio. Those are both generated from Jekyll collections, so creating a new page for a project automatically updates the resume with the appropriate formatting. Each item in the collections is displayed based on a priority value, and can be hidden if it is no longer relevant or not complete yet.

The source code is [here](https://github.com/zacharesmer/zacharesmer), and the documentation for how to edit this site is [here](/how-to-edit/).

Plans for improvements and additions:
- Package it as a Jekyll theme for easier distribution
- Better mobile version
